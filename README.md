- ✅ **Tabs** to switch between Practice / Test / Formulae
- ✅ **Topic filters** using pill-style buttons
- ✅ **Sorting logic** for chapter order and completion
- ✅ **Responsive layout** for mobile and desktop
- ✅ **Dark/Light Mode Toggle** with persistent state
- ✅ **State Management** using Zustand

## 🧠 Thought Process

The project was structured with clarity and future scalability in mind:
- Separated logic from UI components
- Designed for easy data swapping (mock → API)
- Used Tailwind and utility classes for consistency
- Modular state via Zustand for scalability

## 🔮 Future Improvements

Here are some enhancements I’d implement given more time or in a real-world scenario:

- 🔁 **Undo/Redo feature** for filters or actions
- 💾 **Persist user state** (tabs/filters) in localStorage
- 🔎 **Search functionality** for chapters
- 🔀 **Dynamic sorting UI** (dropdowns or drag-to-sort)
- 🔧 **API integration** for dynamic data loading
- ✅ **Unit testing setup** using Jest + React Testing Library
- 💡 **Accessibility improvements** (ARIA, keyboard nav)
- 🎨 **Micro animations** for UI interactions (e.g., hover, tab switch)
- 🌐 **i18n support** for multilingual users
